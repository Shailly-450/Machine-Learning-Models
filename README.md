## Simple Linear Regression Model for Salary Prediction 
 # Overview  This repository contains a simple linear regression model implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library. The model predicts an employee's 
  salary based on their years of experience. 
 # Dataset  The model is trained on the 'Salary_Data.csv' dataset, which includes two columns: 'Years of Experience' and 'Salary'. The dataset is split into training and test sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn. 
 # Model  The linear regression model is implemented using the `LinearRegression` class from scikit-learn. The training process and model evaluation are visualized using matplotlib.  
 # Example Usage  ```python import numpy as np  
 # Suppose you have a new employee with 7 years of experience new_experience = np.array([[7]]) 
 # Use the trained model to predict the salary for the new employee predicted_salary = regressor.predict(new_experience)  print(f"Predicted Salary for an employee with 7 years of experience: ${predicted_salary[0]:,.2f}") ``` 
 # Repository Structure  - `Salary_Data.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing. - `linear_regression_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the linear regression model. - `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview, usage example, and other relevant information.  
 # Dependencies  - pandas - numpy - matplotlib - scikit-learn  
 ## Getting Started  # 1. Clone this repository. # 2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. # 3. Run the `linear_regression_model.ipynb` notebook.  Feel free to explore, contribute, and use this model for your own projects!
