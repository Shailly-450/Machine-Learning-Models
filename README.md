# Machine-Learning-Models
This repository contains all the Machine Learning models i created for practice. 
1. This repository contains a simple linear regression model implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library. The model predicts an employee's salary based on their years of experience.
2. Multiple Linear Regression for Startup Profit Prediction. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (multiple_linear_regression.ipynb) implementing a Multiple Linear Regression model for predicting the profit of startups based on various factors such as R&D Spend, Administration Spend, Marketing Spend, and the State in which the startup operates. The dataset (50_Startups.csv) is used for training and testing the model.
